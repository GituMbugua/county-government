How It Works
============

Once registered, this extension provides a template variable called
:code:`simplemde`, it has:

- a property named :code:`css` that will be rendered as HTML :code:`<link>` tag
  to the SimpleMDE stylesheet either from free CDN or be served from a bundled
  blueprint, also called :code:`simplemde`.

  .. code-block:: jinja

     {{ simplemde.css }}

- a property named :code:`js` that will be rendered as HTML :code:`<script>`
  tag to the SimpleMDE javascript either from free CDN or be served from a
  bundled blueprint, also called :code:`simplemde`.

  .. code-block:: jinja

     {{ simplemde.js }}

- a property named :code:`load` that will be rendered as HTML :code:`<script>`
  tag with javascript code that loads the SimpleMDE Markdown Editor with the
  first :code:`<textarea>` tag.

  .. code-block:: jinja

     {{ simplemde.load }}

- a method named :code:`load_id` that when called with a string, will be
  rendered as HTML :code:`<script>` tag with javascript code that loads the
  SimpleMDE Markdown Editor with the :code:`<textarea>` tag which has the
  specified :code:`id` attribute

  .. code-block:: jinja

     <textarea id="editor"></textarea>
     ...
     {{ simplemde.load_id("editor") }}
