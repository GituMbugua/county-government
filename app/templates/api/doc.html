            <h3>API Documentation</h3>
            <p>To view all the methods available, you should head over to ugatuzi. Everything outlined on this page is simply a high level overview to help you understand what is available.</p>
            <h3>Find Data</h3>
            <p>There are 3 ways to search for and find movies, TV shows and people on TMDb. They're outlined below.</p>
                
              <p> <code>/County</code>  - Text based County is the most common way. You provide a query string and we provide the closest match. County search  by text takes into account all original, translated, alternative names and titles.</p> <br>
                
               <p> <code>/counstituency</code>- Sometimes it useful to search for movies and TV shows based on filters or definable values like ratings, certifications or release dates. The discover method make this easy. For some example queries, and to get an idea about the things you can do with discover, take a look here.</p> <br>
                
               <p><code> /senetor </code> - The last but still very useful way to find data is with existing external IDs. For example, if you know the IMDB ID of a movie, TV show or person, you can plug that value into this method and we'll return anything that matches. This can be very useful when you have an existing tool and are adding our service to the mix.</p> <br>
